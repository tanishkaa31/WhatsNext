# WhatsNext

Created a custom next word prediction model using LSTM layers and NLP techniques. [Inspired by Gboard]


The model has been trained on my whatsapp messages with different users. It takes as input as many words as the user wishes, and predicts the next word based on its training.

PS: Due to privacy concerns, the dataset hasn't been uploaded here. Also, the outputs of the notebook have been hidden for the same reason. Feel free to use the code, and suggest changes :)
